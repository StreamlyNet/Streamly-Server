	   of offline message storage solutions. When the app wants to send a message
	   to an offline recipient it will call this store function. Implementations
	   are expected to store the message somewhere accessible to the recipient.
	   The return should be a `Multiadddr` of the storage location. Upon receiving
	   the response to this function a `Pointer` to the location of the message
	   will be placed in the DHT using the recipient's peer ID as the key.

	   Some storage possibilities include:
	   IPFS Seeding -> assumes this node remains online all the time
	   Dropbox -> go dropbox drivers are available
	   Custom Options -> create your own free or paid service.

	   Note all messages are encrypted before passed in here. */
